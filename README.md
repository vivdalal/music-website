### Assignment 1

<b>Author</b> : Vivek Dalal

Abstract:
I have developed a music website with 3 static pages. The music website lets the user play songs, 
download them, read the lyrics and watch the video of the song.

Instructions to Build:
- Open command prompt/Terminal
- Go the creative_web_site folder
- run "npm install". This should create a node_modules folder which contains all the dependencies of the project

Instructions to run and test:
- run "node server.js" in the Terminal in creative_web_site folder
- Open "http://localhost:3000/" in Chrome/Firefox

I hope you like it! :)
