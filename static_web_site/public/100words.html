        <h1> 100 words  </h1>
        <div>
            Five am trains<br>
            And broken chains<br>
            I called you every afternoon<br>
            Forrest Gump<br>
            And the hurricane trails<br>
            Though we never followed through<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Do you have a 100 words for me?<br>
            'Cause I have only three<br>
            And you couldn’t even sing for me<br>
            And I keep on writing these songs<br>
            Over and over<br>
            And I keep getting closer to you<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<br>
            A lover’s home<br>
            Is never shown<br>
            It’s never known, to the common folk<br>
            You called me over<br>
            Said my name three times over<br>
            But you never looked me in the eyes<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Do you have a 100 words for me?<br>
            'Cause I have only three<br>
            And you couldn’t even sing for me<br>
            And I keep on writing these songs<br>
            Over and over<br>
            And I keep getting closer, to you<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Do you have a 100 words for me?<br>
            'Cause I have only three<br>
            And you couldn’t even sing for me<br>
            And I keep on writing these songs<br>
            Over and over<br>
            And I keep getting closer, to you<br>
            <br>
            And I keep on writing these songs<br>
            Over and over<br>
            As I keep getting older, with you</p>
